# Music Event Application

Music event website for logging / registering accounts, event viewing and creation, and for booking tickets to events. The project is developed using a mix of Python, HTML, and SQL.

This was a group project, with my achievements being:
- Implemented the user registration and login
- CSS styling of the pages
- Added the user id and ervent details to the booking page
- Developed the initial DB and made required adjustments
- Created the events page
- Handled most of the python logic
